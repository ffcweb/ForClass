    Assignment
      1) Create a few variables with strings.
      2) Apply the string methods that we've learned to your strings
      3) Your can try to get the strings from a PROMPT
      4) You must create 4-5 different arrays (vary the type of data )
      5) Display the values from your array and/or specific element position value. 
      6) Practice if - else if - else
